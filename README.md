This an upload of 2 very old projects (2020?). These were made after about 2 months of learning html/css/js

There are lots of things I would do differently now(e.g. use fewer global variables..), but I've left the code intact for reference sake. Please note they were coded using an android tablet IDE so very basic linting assistance and indentations were not automatically added like in VSCode or similar, that's why sometimes the indentations may be missing. Sorry about that ;)

### Hotel Reservation VanillaJS


It was one of my first ~~websites~~ webpages designed that was entirely handcoded (i.e. no frameworks, no libraries, just raw html, self styled css and vanilla javascript). The result is a lean code with 0% fat. Although websites are rarely handcoded anymore due to how slow and complex it can be, this is a valuable skill every developer should know.

The goal of this project was to implement a mobile-only hotel reservation website.That means that visitors on non mobile devices should be automatically diverted away without loading the rest of the website. Additionally, mobile visitors should be able to browse available rooms, pick a date, and see the total price calculated for the specific room.



### Vending Machine Simulator

The objective for this hand-coded web app was to allow a user to enter a code to order a product and simulate the whole experience including adding error notices if the user doesn't order with a valid code, as well as opening the "locked" door to reveal the product for pickup. No libraries or frameworks were used.
