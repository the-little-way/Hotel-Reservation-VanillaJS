### Hotel-Reservation-VanillaJS

This an upload of a very old project (2020?). This was made after about 2 months of learning html/css/js

It was one of my first ~~websites~~ webpages designed that was entirely handcoded (i.e. no frameworks, no libraries, just raw html, self styled css and vanilla javascript). The result is a lean code with 0% fat. Although websites are rarely handcoded anymore due to how slow and complex it can be, this is a valuable skill every developer should know.

The goal of this project was to implement a mobile-only hotel reservation website.That means that visitors on non mobile devices should be automatically diverted away without loading the rest of the website. Additionally, mobile visitors should be able to browse available rooms, pick a date, and see the total price calculated for the specific room.

There are lots of things I would do differently now, but I've left the code intact for reference sake. Please note it was coded using an android tablet IDE so very basic linting assistance and indentations were not automatically added like in VSCode, that's why sometimes the indentations may be missing. Sorry about that ;)
